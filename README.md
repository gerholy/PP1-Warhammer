Warhammer PP1


So first of all i typed in the basics of Html. [ <Doctype html>]

Then i added the stylesheet that we using for this project called css (#Style.css)


Then after that i made a folder called assets , from there i put in my Style.css and i also made a pictures map for backgrounds and small preview pictures etc..


For the text type i went with [Times New Roman] i like it nice and casual.

For the backgrounds i went with the Nav bar color  rgb(163, 158, 114 ah lighter kinda gold one , cause of the background i use has alot of gold white and red in it , so think it matches verry well.


Nav bar A i went with [**8, 8, 8, 0.904**] Dark verry dark , also again cause of the background it melts in verry well in my opinion.
